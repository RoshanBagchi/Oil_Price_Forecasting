Business Problem : Crude oil price prediction is challenging task in oil producing countries. its price is among most complex & tough to model because fluctuation between price of oil are mostly irregular , nonlinear and varies dynamically with high uncertainty.

Objective: The crude oil price prediction can help governments of countries of the world in economic policy making and make quick & operative economic decisions to hedge against probable risk in these economic parameters . Hence, Forecasting of crude oil prices is quit useful. Also, achieving target return on investments, price stability ,  increased profits.

I extracted the sufficient data for our oil price prediction from above site. 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis where it was found that the above mentioned data describing the nature of the data collected.
Corresponding Data Visualisation is performed. Time series lends itself naturally to visualization. Line plots to visualize the time series are popular , but there is a suit of other plots that you can use more to learn about your problem. The more you learn and understand about the data you can develop better forecasting model. 
1.Line plots
2.Histograms and density plots
3.Box and whisker plots
4.Heat map 
Several Model Building using Machine Learning techniques is used. The LSTM model giving the best possible Accuracy and hence is used for the further predictions for the test data and the deployment purpose. 
Here, we have taken LSTM as our Final Model algorithms for the deployment.
The algorithm has achieved 86 % Accuracy and 0.85 as R Squared value
Also it has low MSE, MAE  and RMSE value .
We have deployed the Crude oil price prediction using Stream-lit as the platform
Thankyou.
